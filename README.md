# ColorSortBot
 Autonomous Robotic Arm for Object Manipulation and Sorting based on Color.
 
The ColorSortBot project aims to develop an embedded system consisting of an autonomous robotic arm capable of object manipulation and sorting based on color recognition. 

The system will utilize computer vision techniques, robotic arm control, and decision-making algorithms to identify objects, categorize them based on their color, and sort them into designated bins or locations.
